Proposals
=========


Area to add proposal on how to change the standard.

 - **draft**: anything can be added, just to make your ideas public and avoid duplications. No discussion.
 - **pending**: this is the folder where a discussion can happen via PR to refine proposals.
 - **completed**: in order to move a proposal into the standard, make a PR here. The proposal should not
   be changed anymore at this point.
